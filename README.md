DiskMap Implementation using NavigableMap

Data structure:TreeMap(NavigableMap)

I have used TreeMap collection for disk map implementation.If heap memory will full or outOf space then Objects would be 
stored in Seriliazed File(.ser File) i.e program will use disk memory for storing key-value pairs in file.If we want to get key-value pair,program will fetch data from seriliazed file and display it.All operation would be Thread safe and Synchronized.
